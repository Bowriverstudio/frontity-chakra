# `Frontity Chakra`

This package provides frontity processors that convert components from gutenberg into Chakra components.

Additionally this package has some debugging components for Chakra.

## Frontity Settings

Update `frontity.settings.js`

export default {
  packages: ["frontity-chakra"],

Have a way to include or exclude processors
